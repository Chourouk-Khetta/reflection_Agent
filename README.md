# reflection_Agent

## Overview
This project showcases a reflection-based AI agent that iteratively improves its responses. The agent first generates an answer to a given prompt, evaluates its own output, and then refines it using insights from the reflection stage. This process can repeat for several cycles to produce higher-quality results.

## How It Works
The agent follows a three-step loop:
1. **Generate**: Produce an initial response based on the prompt.
2. **Reflect**: Analyze the response for clarity, correctness, and completeness.
3. **Revise**: Produce an improved version based on the reflection feedback.

Repeating this loop helps the agent correct errors, fill gaps, and enhance overall coherence.

## Purpose
The project serves as an educational example of:
- Iterative improvement in large language models
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Self-critique patterns in agent architectures
